                    V. I. Hutchinson was born and raised in the Bronx borough of New York City. 
                    She is a first generation American born to immigrant parents from the Philippines 
                    and Jamaica. She is an alumna of Baruch College and has worked in the Accounting 
                    field for various profit and nonprofit organizations around the New York City area. 
                    She now lives in South Florida where she continues in her accounting contributions 
                    to the nonprofit sector. Her love for the written word was instilled in her at an 
                    early age by her parents and has persisted throughout her life. <span class="mobile">
                    Some of her favorite writers that inspire her works are Edgar Allen Poe, J. R. R. Tolkien, 
                    Toni Cade Bambara, George Orwell, Stephen King, Zora Neale Hurston, and Agatha Christie. 
                    Her interests are vast and quirky with a sprinkling of fantasy and a pinch of macabre. 
                    Regardless of the genre, V. I. is happiest when the stories and poems she creates can 
                    bring even the slightest glimmer of encouragement, entertainment, and joy to others.</span>
